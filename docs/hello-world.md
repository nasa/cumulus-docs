# HelloWorld

This is our HelloWorld data cookbook. It is our hope that this cookbook will operate as a simple example of the structure of data cookbooks that will be published on this page.

### What is a data cookbook?

A data cookbook is a document that helps unify an institution/user group on a set of terms. Additionally, a data cookbook can be a hub of examples and explanations for workflows.

### Goals

The goal with this specific cookbook, to somewhat reiterate from above, is to provide a simple example of what one might expect when building/viewing a data cookbook.

### Adding a page

As shown in detail on in the relevant documentation(1), you can add a new page to the data cookbook by creating a markdown (`.md`) file in the `docs/` directory. The new page can then be linked to the webpage itself by adding it to the `SUMMARY.md` structure.
