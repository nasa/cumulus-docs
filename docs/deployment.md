# How to Deploy Cumulus

This is a guide for deploying a new instance of Cumulus.

----
## Deploy Cumulus
### Linux/MacOS Requirements:
- zip
- sha1sum
- [node >= 6.9.5, < 8](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

**Note** : To use the AWS command line tool, you'll need to have a python environment and install the AWS CLI package.  Details can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).

### Credentials

**Posting to CMR:**

* CMR Password
* EarthData Client login credentials (username & password)


### Prepare `cumulus` Repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/cumulus.git
    $ cd cumulus
    $ npm install
    $ npm run ybootstrap
    $ npm run build


Note: In-house SSL certificates may prevent successful bootstrap. (i.e. `PEM_read_bio` errors)

### Prepare your DAAC's Repo.

If you already are working with an existing `<daac>-deploy` repository this step can be skipped if you have the appropriate configuration setup.

**Note**: to function correctly the deployment configuration root *must* be at the same root as the cumulus main project directory

    $ cd ..
    $ git clone https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/template-deploy <daac>-deploy
    $ cd <daac>-deploy
    $ npm install

Note: The npm install command will add the [kes](http://devseed.com/kes/) utility to the daac-deploy's `node_packages` directory and will be utilized later for most of the AWS deployment commands

The [`cumulus`](https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/cumulus) project contains default configration values in `cumulus/packages/deployment/app.example`, however these need to be customized for your cumulus app.  Begin by copying the template directory to your project, you will modify it for you daac specific needs later.

    $ cp -r ../cumulus/packages/deployment/app.example ./app

[Create a new repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/) `<daac>-deploy` so that you can track daac-specific configuraiton changes:

    $ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/<daac>-deploy
	$ git push origin master

You can then add/commit changes as needed.


### Prepare AWS

**Create S3 Buckets:**

The following s3 buckets should be created (replacing prefix with whatever you'd like, generally your organization/DAAC's name):

* `<prefix>-internal`
* `<prefix>-private`
* `<prefix>-protected`
* `<prefix>-public`


**Note**: s3 bucket object names are global and must be unique across all users/locations/etc.

These buckets can be created with the AWS command line utility or the web interfece.

See [creating s3 buckets](./create_bucket.md) for more information on how to create a bucket.

**Set Access Keys:**

Create [Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html) for a user with IAM Create-User permissions, then export the access keys:

    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS access key>
    $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS secret key>
    $ export AWS_REGION=<region>  # this should be us-east-1 unless told otherwise.

If you don't want to set environment variables, [access keys can be stored locally via the AWS CLI.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)

### Create a deployer role

The `deployer` configuration sets up an IAM role with permissions for deploying the cumulus stack.

__All deployments in the various config.yml files inherit from the `default` deployment, and new deployments only need to override relevant settings.__

**Add new deployment to `<daac>-deploy/deployer/config.yml`:**

    <deployer-deployment-name>:          # e.g. dev (Note: Omit brackets, i.e. NOT <dev>)
      prefix: <stack-prefix>    # prefixes CloudFormation-created deployer resources and permissions
      stackName: <stack-name>   # name of this deployer stack in CloudFormation (e.g. <prefix>-deployer)
      buckets:
        internal: <prefix>-internal  # Previously created internal bucket name
      shared_data_bucket: cumulus-data-shared  # Devseed-managed shared bucket (contains custom ingest lmabda functions/common ancillary files)

**Deploy `deployer` stack**[^1]

    $ kes cf deploy --kes-folder deployer --deployment <deployer-deployment-name> --region <region>

Note: If global `kes` commands do not work, your `npm install` of the `<daac>-deploy` repo has included a local copy under `./node_modules/.bin/kes`

A successful completion will result in output similar to:

    $ kes cf deploy --kes-folder deployer --deployment default --region us-east-1
    Template saved to deployer/cloudformation.yml
    Uploaded: s3://<bucket-name>/<stack-name>/cloudformation.yml
    Waiting for the CF operation to complete
    CF operation is in state of CREATE_COMPLETE

This creates a new DeployerRole [role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) named `<deployer-stack-name>-DeployerRole-<generatedhashvalue>`.

### Create IAM Roles

The `iam` configuration creates 4 roles used internally by the cumulus stack.

**Add new deployment to `<daac>-deploy/iam/config.yml`:**

    <iam-deployment-name>:
      prefix: <stack-prefix>  # prefixes CloudFormation-created iam resources and permissions, MUST MATCH prefix in deployer stack
      stackName: <stack-name> # name of this iam stack in CloudFormation (e.g. <prefix>-iams)
      buckets:
        internal: <prefix>-internal
        private: <prefix>-private
        protected: <prefix>-protected
        public: <prefix>-public

**Deploy `iam` stack**[^1]

    $ kes cf deploy --kes-folder iam --deployment <iam-deployment-name> --region <region>

If the IAM deployment command  succeeds, you should see 4 new roles in the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home):

* `<stack-name>-ecs`
* `<stack-name>-lambda-api-gateway`
* `<stack-name>-lambda-processing`
* `<stack-name>-steprole`

The same information can be obtained from the AWS command line: `aws iam list-roles`


### Assign an `sts:AssumeRole` policy to a new or existing user:

Using the [command line interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-iam-policy.html) or [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) create and assign a policy to a user who will deploy cumulus.

This AssumeRole policy, when applied to a user, allows the user to act with the permissions described by the DeployerRole.

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
                "Resource": "<arn:DeployerRole>"
            }
        ]
    }

Replace the `<arn:DeployerRole>` with value created when you deployed the deployer stack. The cli command `aws iam list-roles | grep <deployer-stack>` will show you the correct ARN.



**Change AWS Access Keys**

Create [Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html) for the user who will assume the DeployerRole in IAM, then export the access keys:

    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS access key> (User with sts:AssumeRole Permission for <arn:DeployerRole>)
    $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS secret key> (User with sts:AssumeRole Permission for <arn:DeployerRole>)
    $ export AWS_REGION=<region>


### Configure Cumulus Stack

This updates the file copied in the [Prepare your DAAC's Repo](#prepare-your-daacs-repo) step.

**update `<daac>-deploy/app/config.yml`**

The various configuration sections are described below with a sample `config.yml` at the end. It is not necessary to configure the CMR/distribution sections if you're not utilizing CMR/deploying for the first time.

###### buckets

The config buckets should map to the same names you used when creating buckets in the [Prepare AWS](#prepare-aws) step.

###### iams

Add the ARNs for each of the four roles and one instanceProfile created in the [Create IAM Roles](create-iam-roles) step.    For more inforamtion on how to locate them, see [Locating Cumulus IAM Roles](iam_roles.md).


###### ecs

Configuration for the Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) instance.   This shouldn't need to be changed for default installations.

###### Sample config.yml

	 <cumulus-deployment-name>:
	   stackName: <prefix>-cumulus
	   stackNameNoDash: <Prefix>Cumulus

	   apiStage: dev

	   ecs:
		 instanceType: t2.micro
		 desiredInstances: 0

	  buckets:
		 internal: <prefix>-internal
		 private: <prefix>-private
		 protected: <prefix>-protected
		 public: <prefix>-public

	   iams:
		 ecsRoleArn: arn:aws:iam::<aws-account-id>:role/<iams-prefix>-ecs
		 lambdaApiGatewayRoleArn: arn:aws:iam::<aws-account-id>:role/<iams-prefix>-lambda-api-gateway
		 lambdaProcessingRoleArn: arn:aws:iam::<aws-account-id>:role/<iams-prefix>-lambda-processing
		 stepRoleArn: arn:aws:iam::<aws-account-id>:role/<iams-prefix>-steprole
		 instanceProfile: arn:aws:iam::<aws-account-id>:instance-profile/<iams-prefix>-ecs

		 urs_url: https://uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/ #make sure to include the trailing slash

		 # if not specified the value of the apigateway backend endpoint is used
		 # api_backend_url: https://apigateway-url-to-api-backend/ #make sure to include the trailing slash

		 # if not specified the value of the apigateway dist url is used
		 # api_distribution_url: https://apigateway-url-to-distribution-app/ #make sure to include the trailing slash




#### Set up an environment file:

Copy `app/.env.sample to .env` and add CMR/earthdata client credentials:

    CMR_PASSWORD=cmrpassword
    EARTHDATA_CLIENT_ID=clientid
    EARTHDATA_CLIENT_PASSWORD=clientpassword

To begin with deploying "Hello World" you can leave CMR_PASSWORD unchanged as you won't use the CMR system.  You will need to have an `EARTHDATA_CLIENT_ID` and `EARTHDATA_CLIENT_PASSWORD` if you want to login to the application.  You can use any url for the redirect URL, as it will be updated in a later step.

Be sure that `.env` is `.gitignore`-d so that it is not included in your repository.





##### Earthdata Login

The cumulus stack is expected to authenticate with [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/documentation). Create and register a new application. If you didn't modify the template you will use the [User Accpetance Tools (UAT) site](https://uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov). Follow the directions on [how to register an application.](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Register+An+Application). in the `.env` file, replace `clientid` and `clientpassword` with the newly generated values.

----
### Deploy the Cumulus stack

Once the preceeding configuration steps have completed, run the following to deploy cumulus from your `<daac>-deploy` root directory:


    $ kes cf deploy --kes-folder app --region <region> --template ../cumulus/packages/deployment/app --deployment <cumulus-deployment-name> --role <arn:deployerRole>



You can monitor the progess of the stack deployment from the [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home), this step takes a few minutes.


A successful completion will result in output similar to:

	 $ ./node_modules/.bin/kes cf deploy --kes-folder app --region <region> --template ../cumulus/packages/deployment/app --deployment daac --role arn:aws:iam::<userIDnumbers>:role/<deployer-name>-DeployerRole-<HASHNUMBERS>

	Add this url to URS:  https://<kido2r7kji>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/redirect

	Api:  https://<czbbkscuy6>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/
	Add this url to URS:  https://<czbbkscuy6>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/token

	Uploading Workflow Input Templates
	Uploaded: s3://<prefix>-internal/<prefix>-cumulus/workflows/HelloWorldWorkflow.json
	Uploaded: s3://<prefix>-internal/<prefix>-cumulus/workflows/list.json


Note that the output of a successful deploy gives you urls that you will use to update your Earthdata application.

#### Update Earthdata Application.

You will need to add two redirect urls to your Earthdata login application.
login to URS (UAT), and under My Applications -> Application Administration -> use the edit icon of your application.  Then under Manage -> redirect URIs, add the API url returned from the stack deployment, e.g. `https://<czbbkscuy6>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/token`.
And add the Distribution url `https://<kido2r7kji>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/redirect`[^3]. You may also delete the placeholder url you used to create the application.

## Deploy Cumulus Dashboard

### Prepare AWS

**Create S3 bucket:**

* Create it, e.g. `<prefix>-dashboard`.
* Configure the bucket to host a website:
  * AWS console:  "Properties" -> "Static Website Hosting", point to `index.html`
  * CLI: `aws s3 website s3://<prefix>-dashboard --index-document index.html`
* The bucket's url will be `http://<prefix>-dashboard.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com` or you can find it on the AWS console via "Properties" -> "Static website hosting" -> "Endpoint"

### Install dashboard

    from your root deploy directory
    $ git clone https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/cumulus-dashboard
    $ cd cumulus-dashboard
    $ npm install

### Dashboard Configuration

Configure dashboard:


Update config in `app/scripts/config/config.js`:

replace the default apiRoot `https://wjdkfyb6t6.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/` with your app's apiroot.[^2]

    apiRoot: process.env.APIROOT || 'https://<czbbkscuy6>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/'

**Note**  evironmental variables are available during the build:`DAAC_NAME`, `STAGE`, `HIDE_PDR`, any of these can be set on the command line to override the values contained in `config.js`.


Build the dashboard:

      $ npm run build


### Dashboard Deployment

Deploy dashboard to s3 bucket from the `cumulus-dashboard` directory:

      $ aws s3 sync dist s3://<prefix>-dashboard --acl public-read



You should be able to visit the dashboard website at `http://<prefix>-dashboard.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com` or find the url
`<prefix>-dashboard` -> "Properties" -> "Static website hosting" -> "Endpoint"






----
## Updating Cumulus deployment

Once deployed for the first time, any future updates to the role/stack configuration files/version of Cumulus can be deployed and will update the appropriate portions of the stack as needed.

## Update Roles

    $ kes cf deploy --kes-folder deployer --deployment <deployment-name> --region <region> # e.g. us-east-1
    $ kes cf deploy --kes-folder iam --deployment <deployment-name> --region <region> # e.g. us-east-1

## Update Cumulus

    $ kes cf deploy --kes-folder config --region <region> --deployment <deployment-name> --role <arn:deployerRole>


----
## Develop Lambda Functions

### Develop a new Lambda

To develop a new lambda from a sample, create a new folder in `cumulus/tasks/` and run `npm init`:

    $ cd ../cumulus/cumulus/tasks
    $ mkdir new-lambda
    $ cd new-lambda
    $ npm init

Or copy an existing lambda function to customize:

        $ cd ../cumulus/cumulus/tasks
        $ cp discover-pdrs new-lambda

Modify package.json:

* name
* version
* description
* test script
* dependencies (NOT devDependencies)

### Build a Lambda

To build node.js lambda functions, use webpack to pack into single .js with dependencies:

    $ npm run build

Alternatively, to monitor for changes and auto-rebuild:

    $ npm run watch

For non-node lambdas not included in cumulus repo, upload .zip to s3 and modify lambdas.yml as previously shown.

### Deploy a Lambda

For new lambdas, update `<daac>-deploy/lambdas.yml` by adding a new entry.
E.g.: node.js sample for '../cumulus/cumulus/tasks/sample-lambda' in the cumulus repo):

    - name: <LambdaName>                                       # eg:  LambdaSample (does not need to conform to dirname)
      handler: <dir>.<function>                                # eg:  sample-lambda.handler (assuming file has module.exports.handler = <someFunc>)
      timeout: <ms>                                            # eg:  300
      source: '../cumulus/cumulus/tasks/<dir>/dist/<file.js>'  # eg:  '../cumulus/cumulus/tasks/sample-lambda/dist/index.js'

For non-node.js lambda code (e.g. python) uploaded as a .zip to an S3 bucket:

    - name: PyLambda
      handler: <file.py>.<function>               # eg:  lambda_handler.handler for lambda_handler.py with:  def handler(event, context):
      timeout: <ms>
      s3Source:
        bucket: '{{buckets.internal}}'            # refers to bucket set in config.yml
        key: deploy/cumulus-process/<dir>/<file>  # eg: deploy/cumulus-process/modis/0.3.0b3.zip
      runtime: python2.7                          # Node is default, otherwise specify.

To deploy all changes to /tasks/ and lambdas.yml:

    $ kes cf deploy --kes-folder app --template ../cumulus/packages/deployment/app --region <region> --deployment <deployment-name> --role <arn:deployerRole>

To deploy modifications to a single lambda package:

    $ kes lambda <LambdaName> --kes-folder app --template ../cumulus/packages/deployment/app --deployment <deployment-name> --role <arn:deployerRole>



### Footnotes:

[^1]: Creating the deployer role and the iam  actions require more permissions than a typical AWS user will have and should be run by an administrator.

[^2]: The API root can be found a number of ways. The easiest is to note it in the output of the app deployment step. But you can also find it from the `AWS console -> Amazon API Gateway -> APIs -> <prefix>-cumulus-backend -> Dashboard`, and reading the url at the top "invoke this API"

[^3]: To add another redirect URIs to your application. On EarthData home page, select "My Applications" Scroll down to "Application Administration" and use the edit icon for your application.  Then Manage -> Redirect URIs.
