# Cumulus Architecture

Below, find a diagram with the components that comprise an instance of Cumulus.

<img src="/images/cumulus-arch-diagram.png">

While the internals are complex, the boxes represent components which are easy to understand:

* Every Cumulus application requires it's own Cumulus deployment (lower left corner)
* Every Cumulus deployment comes with:
    * DynamoDB and ElasticSearch datastores
    * an API Gateway for managing collections, providers, granules and other Cumulus resources, and,
    * internal lambda functions and queues for managing Cumulus workflows
* Every Cumulus application should define a set of workflows, which are deployed as AWS Step Functions along with all other AWS Cumulus resources.

## Developing a Cumulus Application

Cumulus is a collection of resources for Cumulus developers. These resources are:

* `@cumulus/deployment`: A node module for creating a Cumulus deployment. A Cumulus deployment is comprised of 4 AWS Cloudformation stacks. Each Cumulus application will have it's own cloudformation stacks.
* `@cumulus/api`: A node module for deploying the Cumulus API and other AWS resources required to run Cumulus workflows.
* Node modules for tasks to be run as part of Cumulus Workflows, for example `@cumulus/parse-pdr`
* [`cumulus-dashboard`](https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/cumulus-dashboard): Code to generate and deploy the dashboard for the Cumulus API.

## Cloudformation Stacks

1. **IAM:** Sets up IAM roles for AWS services deployed by the Cumulus stack to be assigned the required policies.
2. **Cumulus:**
    * Lambda functions and ECS activities (required for workflows)
    * Step functions (aka workflows)
    * Elasticsearch for search on workflow executions and logs
    * DynamoDB for storing (earthdata) users, rules, collections and providers.
3. **Cumulus API Default** and **Cumulus API V1:** Nested stacks deploying API Gateway resources


## Cumulus Dashboard

Uses S3 static website hosting built using the [cumulus-dashboard](https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/cumulus-dashboard) repository.
